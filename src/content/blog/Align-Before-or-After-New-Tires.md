description: Alignment Timing 101 Before or After New Tires? Experts Spill the Beans
---

There is some debate among experts about whether to do an alignment before or after getting new tires. Some argue that it is best to wait until after the new tires are mounted to ensure that the alignment is 100% accurate, while others argue that it doesn't matter and that you can do it before or after.

Most experts agree that the only effect worn tires have on your alignment is a change to the vehicle’s ride height which, given today’s steering and suspension design, should be negligible. However, if you are experiencing uneven tire wear, you should have an alignment performed before you purchase new tires. If you are unable to do so, you should have an alignment performed as soon as possible after the new tires are mounted to prevent uneven wear on the new tires. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide when to get an alignment, but it is generally recommended to have your car or truck aligned every 10,000 miles to help ensure that it stays in proper alignment.

## Ride height and alignment due to new tires 
The difference in ride height due to new tires (with more tread) compared to old ones could be minimal, especially in your example where the difference is 1/4 inch. In most cases, this small change in ride height is unlikely to have a significant impact on the alignment, as modern suspension systems are designed to accommodate some variation.

Ride height and alignment due to new tires generally do not pose significant issues regarding alignment. According to automotive experts, worn tires primarily affect ride height, which, given current steering and suspension designs, should be minimal and unlikely to influence alignment[1][2]. Older vehicles with adjustable camber, toe, and caster levels may require attention after new tires are fitted, but modern vehicles with fixed front ends typically only require adjustments to toe-in and toe-out levels[1][2]. Therefore, it does not matter whether you perform an alignment before or after installing new tires; however, it is beneficial to maintain proper alignment to protect your investment in new tires and enhance their performance[2].

## Toe Adjustment
It's important to note that toe alignment refers to the angle at which the tires point inward or outward when viewed from above. Installing new tires generally shouldn't affect the toe setting unless there are significant changes in tire size or type.

It is a good idea to get a wheel alignment after installing new tires[1][4]. An alignment helps ensure that all four tires are correctly angled with each other and the road. If you don’t get an alignment with new tires, you may experience a rough ride and experience uneven tire wear earlier than normal, which can shorten your tires’ lifespan[4]. The general rule of thumb is to get an alignment about every year[4]. However, you should check your owner's manual to know what's best for your vehicle. If you often drive in harsh conditions or on pothole-riddled streets, you may need an alignment more frequently[4]. The alignment procedure usually takes about 30 minutes to an hour to complete[1]. The toe angle is one of the three angles that are adjusted during an alignment, and it affects how much the tire points in or out[1][2].

## Suspension Components can affect tire alignment

While changing tires might not directly alter the alignment settings, it's worth noting that worn suspension components can affect alignment. If the vehicle has worn-out suspension parts, replacing the tires might not fully address alignment issues.

Yes, suspension components can affect tire alignment. Misaligned suspension components can cause uneven tire wear, increased stress on suspension components, and altered handling and stability[2]. The suspension system includes components such as springs, struts, shocks, and tires, which can all be negatively affected by a misaligned frame[1]. If the position of any of these components is altered, it could cause damage to the alignment and negatively affect the suspension[1]. Therefore, it is important to check the suspension components and ensure they are in good condition before getting an alignment[4].

## Tire Tread Wear

Tire wear over time can affect alignment, and this is a reason why regular alignments are recommended. Uneven tire wear can be an indicator of alignment issues. However, installing new tires with even tread depth should not introduce alignment problems on its own.
Uneven tire wear can indeed be an indicator of alignment issues. Poor alignment is a common cause of uneven tire wear, and it can lead to reduced efficiency and shorter tire life. Signs of poor alignment include uneven or rapid tire wear, a crooked steering wheel when driving straight, squealing tires, shaking or vibrating steering wheel, and a loose or unresponsive steering wheel[1]. Additionally, complex alignment issues, such as a combination of out-of-spec toe and caster settings, can cause irregular tire wear patterns[2]. Therefore, if you notice uneven tire wear, it's advisable to have your alignment checked to prevent further issues.

## what is the purpose of tire alignment
The purpose of tire alignment, also known as wheel alignment, is to adjust the angles of the tires to ensure that they are making proper contact with the road. This adjustment involves adjusting the camber, caster, and toe of the tires, which affects how they make contact with the road[2][3]. Proper alignment can help your tires perform properly, last longer, and improve handling[3]. It can also prevent excessive tire wear, suspension failure, unsafe operation, excessive steering wheel play, driver fatigue, and more[2]. If your vehicle is out of alignment, you may notice uneven tire wear, steering that pulls to one side, or a vibrating steering wheel[2][3]. It is recommended to have your car or truck aligned every 10,000 miles to help ensure that it stays in proper alignment[2][3]. If you are experiencing uneven tire wear, you should have an alignment performed before you purchase new tires. If you are unable to do so, you should have an alignment performed as soon as possible after the new tires are mounted to prevent uneven wear on the new tires[4].

## what are the different types of tire alignment
There are different types of tire alignment, including:

1. **Front-End Alignment**: In this type of alignment, only the front axle's angles are adjusted[5].
2. **Thrust Angle Alignment**: This is done by aligning the front wheels of a car to the rear axle[1].
3. **Four-Wheel Alignment**: This involves adjusting all four wheels to be parallel to each other and perpendicular to the ground[5].

These different types of alignments are used to ensure that the tires make proper contact with the road, which can help improve handling, prevent uneven tire wear, and maintain vehicle stability[3].

## what is the cost of a four-wheel tire alignment
The cost of a four-wheel alignment can range from approximately $100 to $175, depending on various factors such as the type of vehicle, location, and the specific alignment package offered by the mechanic[1][3]. Keep in mind that prices can vary based on your region and the condition of your vehicle's suspension system. Some automotive shops may offer lifetime alignment service packages, which can provide alignments every six months or 6,000 miles for a single up-front cost[1].

## what is the difference between a two-wheel and four-wheel tire alignment
The main difference between a two-wheel and four-wheel tire alignment is the number of wheels that are adjusted during the alignment. Here's a summary of the differences:

- **Two-Wheel Alignment (or Front-End Alignment)**: This process involves adjusting the front suspension and steering. It may also include a thrust angle adjustment to ensure that all four wheels are in perfect alignment with each other. This type of alignment is typically done on the front wheels and is also known as a "front-end alignment"[1].

- **Four-Wheel Alignment**: In this type of alignment, a technician adjusts the front suspension, steering, and rear suspension to ensure that all four wheels are in alignment. This comprehensive adjustment involves adjusting the camber, caster, toe, and thrust angle on all four wheels of the vehicle[1].

In general, a four-wheel alignment is recommended when fitting new tires to ensure that all wheels are properly aligned, which can help prevent uneven tire wear, increased fuel consumption, and poor handling[2].

<h3>how do i know if i need 2 wheel or 4 wheel alignment?</h3>

To determine whether you need a two-wheel or four-wheel alignment, you should consider the type of your vehicle and the symptoms you are experiencing. In general, most modern vehicles like family cars, small 4x4s, crossovers, and people carriers require a four-wheel alignment, especially all-wheel drive models. However, there are exceptions, such as large trucks and classic cars with solid rear axles that may only require a two-wheel alignment[1]. Signs that you may need an alignment include vehicle pulling to one side, uneven tire wear, off-center steering wheel, or a vibrating steering wheel[1][5]. If you are unsure, it is best to consult a professional technician to determine the appropriate type of alignment for your vehicle.
