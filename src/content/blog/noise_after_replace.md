## Rubbing noise after changing Brake Pads
A rubbing noise after replacing brake pads can occur due to several reasons. One possible explanation is that the new brake pads may not fit perfectly onto the rotor immediately after installation, causing slight rubbing or chattering[4]. Another reason could be that the dust shields or splash shields, which protect the brake components from debris, become bent during the replacement process and start rubbing against the rotor[5][4]. Additionally, metal clips from aftermarket brake pads may be slightly tighter than original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts, leading to grinding noises[1]. It's also important to ensure that the lug nuts are properly torqued and that nothing is protruding from the brake system, potentially catching on the tire[3]. To address these issues, one would typically need to adjust the position of the dust shields, recheck the lug nut torque, or return to the mechanic who completed the service to correct any mistakes made during the installation process.

## Check for Foreign Objects and Inspect the Dust Shield

Examine the area around the brake assembly, especially between the rotor and the dust shield. Sometimes, small rocks or debris can get lodged in there and cause a rubbing noise. Ensure there's nothing caught in that space.

Check the dust shield behind the rotor. It might be slightly bent or touching the rotor during rotation, causing the rubbing noise. Ensure it's properly aligned and not making contact with the rotor.

Check Wheel Bearings:
Although less likely after brake work, it's worth checking the wheel bearings for play or damage. Worn or damaged wheel bearings can also produce rubbing noises.

## Verify Rotor Runout

To verify rotor runout, you can use a dial indicator to measure the lateral runout of the rotor. This is important because excessive runout can cause brake pedal pulsation. Here are the general steps to measure rotor runout using a dial indicator:

1. **Attach the Dial Indicator**: Attach the dial indicator to a stable point on the vehicle, ensuring it is securely mounted.

2. **Set the Plunger**: Position the plunger of the dial indicator about 1/4" from the edge of the rotor on a smooth portion of the rotor surface.

3. **Add Tension to the Rotor**: Rotate the tension handle of the dial indicator to hold it in position and prevent vibration during the reading.

4. **Take the Rotor Runout Reading**: Rotate the rotor in the direction that the dial indicator tip is pointing and observe the lowest and highest numbers reached during one revolution. The runout is the difference between these two numbers.

If the runout exceeds the specified limit for your vehicle, you may need to re-index the rotor or consider replacing it. Using a flat surface like a stone kitchen benchtop, as suggested in one of the forum posts, may not provide an accurate measurement of runout.

Lateral runout, or side-to-side motion of the rotor, is a critical parameter for this vehicle, with a maximum specification of 27 inches. Excessive lateral runout can lead to thickness variation, resulting in pedal pulsation. To ensure the proper functioning of the rotor, we will inspect lateral runout on this vehicle. The hub is clean, the rotor is securely installed, and bolts are evenly tightened. After clamping the dial indicator, we will rotate the rotor and observe the dial indicator reading. Currently, at 0.002 inches, the rotor is within acceptable limits. If the reading exceeds 0.002 inches, a corrective action involves loosening the lug nuts, rotating the rotor 180Â°, and rechecking the lateral runout using a dial indicator.

## Other


Caliper Bracket and Mounting Bolts:
Ensure the caliper bracket and mounting bolts are tight and secure. Loose bolts can lead to misalignment and cause rubbing noises.

Check Wheel Bearings:
Although less likely after brake work, it's worth checking the wheel bearings for play or damage. Worn or damaged wheel bearings can also produce rubbing noises.

Reassess Caliper Operation:
Double-check the caliper operation by retracting the piston slightly, then reinstalling the caliper onto the bracket. Make sure it moves freely on the bracket and is not excessively tight.

Inspect Anti-Rattle Clips:
Ensure that any anti-rattle clips or shims between the brake pads and caliper bracket are properly seated and not causing any interference.

Double-Check Pad Placement:
Confirm that the brake pads are correctly installed and not crooked within the caliper bracket. Misaligned pads can lead to uneven contact with the rotor.
