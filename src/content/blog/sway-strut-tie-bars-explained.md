## Table of contents
## Summary

Sway bars, strut bars, and tie bars are all components that can be added to a car's suspension system to improve handling and stability. 

- **Sway bars** are designed to flex and are constructed of spring steel. They act directly on the suspension during cornering and control side-to-side weight transfer and the difference in ride height between two wheels on the same axle while allowing the suspension to move independently. Sway bars will have a more direct effect on handling characteristics than strut bars will[2].

- **Strut bars** are designed to be inflexible and are constructed of aluminum or normal steel. They tie the strut or suspension towers together and are a body stiffening device. Strut bars add body rigidity and make the body less twisty, which helps turn-in and direction changes. They increase ride quality by reducing uncontrolled motions and also improve handling[2].

- **Tie bars** are simply a structural stiffener and not really part of the suspension. They provide an extra connection between two parts of the chassis, reducing chassis flex. That flexing slightly changes suspension geometry. Stiffening the chassis reduces that change[3].

In general, sway bars and strut bars serve completely different purposes, with sway bars adding suspension stiffness and strut bars adding body rigidity. Tie bars are a structural stiffener that reduces chassis flex[2][3].

## Sway bar

Sway bars, often overlooked, stand out as a valuable yet underestimated upgrade due to their ease of installation and cost-effectiveness, contributing significantly to the enhancement of a car's handling. This upgrade proves particularly beneficial for smaller, agile vehicles such as the Miata, designed with an emphasis on handling prowess. Conversely, for larger vehicles like SUVs or muscle cars, alternative upgrades such as exhaust systems or subwoofers might be deemed more appropriate.

Functioning akin to substantial springs, sway bars play a pivotal role by linking the left and right suspensions across an axle. Their primary purpose lies in resisting the twisting forces generated during cornering maneuvers, thereby mitigating body roll and maintaining the car's flat and stable posture throughout.

When considering upgraded sway bars, prioritizing thicker bars is essential as they offer increased resistance to twisting forces. Additionally, the significance of adjustability in these sway bars is highlighted, providing the flexibility to fine-tune handling characteristics. This adjustability is achieved through multiple holes at the ends of the sway bars where end links can be connected, allowing for precise adjustments to optimize balance and performance, both at the front and rear of the vehicle.

A crucial warning is issued regarding the proper tightening of end link jam nuts during installation. Failing to secure these nuts adequately could result in complications such as rattling, potentially necessitating the replacement of components. Therefore, meticulous attention to detail during the installation process is emphasized to ensure the longevity and effectiveness of the sway bar upgrade.

After the installation process, a discernible improvement in responsiveness. The front end of the vehicle exhibits a newfound immediacy, and weight transfers more effectively, contributing to an overall enhanced driving experience. This positive transformation underscores the efficacy of sway bars as a worthwhile investment for those seeking notable improvements in their vehicle's performance and handling dynamics. 

## Strut bar

Strut bars, also known as strut braces or strut tower braces (STB), are automotive suspension accessories primarily installed on monocoque or unibody chassis vehicles to enhance their overall stiffness, particularly between the strut towers. On cars equipped with a MacPherson strut suspension system, where the spring and shock absorber are combined into one unit, the strut towers bear most of the vertical suspension load. By connecting these towers using a strut bar, the load distribution is improved, resulting in better steering response and reduced chassis flex during cornering[1].

There are generally two types of strut bars:

1. Single-piece strut bar: This design offers greater durability and increased rigidity when compared to the hinged type strut bar. It does not allow movement or pivoting, making it more rigid but potentially harder to install around engine components[1].
2. Hinged type strut bar: Although less rigid than the single-piece version, the hinged type allows for easier installation around engine components due to its ability to move or pivot[1].

The primary benefits of strut bars include:

- Reduced chassis flex and increased steering control accuracy in corners
- Improved driving dynamics and drive comfort
- Minimized risk of chassis damage and passenger injury during impacts[1][2]

Some manufacturers avoid using strut bars because they connect the strut towers, meaning that if a significant impact occurs on one side of the vehicle, the forces could be distributed to both struts, potentially causing damage to both sides and raising repair costs[1]. Despite this potential disadvantage, many enthusiasts choose to install strut bars to optimize performance and handling. Manufacturers offer custom-made strut bars tailored to various vehicle models, ensuring proper fitment and compatibility[2][4][5].

Strut bars, or strut tower bars, serve as a chassis bracing method. They usually come in the form of a rod or bar that extends and connects the left and right suspension strut towers. Crafted from rigid materials like aluminum or carbon fiber, these bars aim to reinforce and stiffen the chassis by linking those two points together.

Originally designed to counter flaws with McPherson strut-type suspensions, strut bars have proven beneficial for various suspension types. In McPherson strut designs, the load is primarily at the top, stressing the strut towers, especially during bumps or high-speed cornering. While strut bars won't necessarily make a car faster, they significantly enhance stability, predictability, and ease of handling by reducing chassis flex. This reduction in flex provides a more direct driving feel.

Affordability and ease of installation make strut bars a great value, especially for older cars. Installation typically takes less than 5-10 minutes. However, like any modification, they have some downsides. Strut bars mainly impact cornering or bumpy surfaces, so track cars might not see significant benefits. Also, they occupy some engine space, potentially interfering with other modifications you may have.

Here, we showcase two different styles of strut bars. The first is an STI flexible strut bar with a joint in the middle, making installation easier. The joint, made of rigid metal, doesn't compromise the bar's effectiveness. The second is a Speed Rush strut bar for a Forester XD, which can be taken apart into three pieces for more straightforward installation.

For the installation, start by removing the bolts on the strut tower, leaving only the studs. Position the strut bar so that the holes on each side align with the studs on the strut tower. If the strut bar can come apart and you're having difficulty fitting it, you might need to disassemble it to get a proper fit. Once in place, reuse the bolts from before to secure the strut bar onto the strut tower.

And just like that, the installation is complete. While some may notice a subtle change in steering feel, opting for a strut bar to enhance chassis stiffness is always a wise move. Thanks for tuning in!
