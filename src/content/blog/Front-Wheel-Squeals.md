Possible explanations might include brake-related problems, such as issues with pads and rotors, or perhaps there was some temporary debris causing the noise that cleared on its own.

While it's challenging to provide a definite solution without a physical inspection, here are some potential suggestions:


1. **Brake-related Issues:**
   - **Brake Pads/Rotors Seating:** If the noise occurred after installing new pads and rotors, it's possible that they needed some time to seat themselves. The noise stopping could be a positive sign, but if it returns, give it a bit more time or consider checking the installation.

2. **Wheel Bearing Issues:**
   - **Check Wheel Bearings:** Even though the noise goes away when braking, it's still worth checking the wheel bearings. They could be intermittently causing the noise. Inspect for play or unusual movement in the wheels.

3. **Suspension Components:**
   - **Inspect Suspension Components:** Squeaking noises can sometimes be related to suspension components. Check for worn-out bushings, control arms, or other suspension parts that could be causing the issue.

4. **Debris or Foreign Objects:**
   - **Inspect for Debris:** Look for any debris, rocks, or foreign objects stuck between the brake components or around the wheel. Sometimes, these can cause intermittent noises.

5. **Check Brake Calipers:**
   - **Inspect Brake Calipers:** Ensure that the brake calipers are securely in place and not causing any friction with the wheels. Loose or misaligned calipers could lead to squeaking sounds.

6. **Professional Inspection:**
   - **Visit a Mechanic:** If the issue persists or becomes more consistent, it's advisable to take the car to a qualified mechanic. They can perform a detailed inspection, potentially using diagnostic tools, to identify the root cause of the problem.

Remember,  a hands-on inspection by a professional is often the most effective way to diagnose and address car issues.
